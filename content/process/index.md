*TODO - add link to pizza window in Portfolio, and explanation that we're walking through its process*

## Vision and Requirements

The first step is learning about the kind of stained glass you're intersted in and the space where it will be installed
* Vision
  * Do you have any examples or styles of stained glass in mind?
  * Whether it's an idea in your head, a picture from Google Images, or a detailed mockup, we'll meet you where you are
* Installation
  * What are the dimensions of the space where the window will go?
  * Do you plan to hang the window with chain and hooks?
  * Which direction will the window be facing?  Direct or indirect sunlight?
* Framing
  * Will the window be wood-framed?  
  * Any preferred wood for the frame (pine, oak)?  Stain color?

Once the glass is purchased, it's a good opportunity to show you how it looks in the light, from the direction it will face when installed.

## Subassembly

Holes can be drilled for eye hooks, and brass or silver eye hooks provided.
