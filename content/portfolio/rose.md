This entrance window was requested by a customer in Buckeye, who was looking to add some privacy without using curtains, in a way that blended with the interior decoration.  We took down measurements, drew up the pattern, and reviewed with the client.

The window uses a mix of opalescent and kokomo glass, along with glue chip to form the rose's background.

Framed in solid red oak, stained with an oak stain, and finished with two coats of polyurethane.
